Version 0.4 : 
    Updated and standardised error reporting.
    Standardised the debug logging messages.
    Removed the requirement to recursively list the repository at mount
    time. This trades slower command execution for quicker mounting and
    always up-to-date repository contents.
    Fix listing of files and directories in the root of the mounted
    filesystem.
    Fix a segfault caused by an off-by-one in the allocation of space
    for the fullpath buffer in _svnclient_list_func().
    In svnfs_readdir(), don't return subdirectory files.
